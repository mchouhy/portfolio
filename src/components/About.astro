    About

    <p class="text-xl text-pretty leading-8">
      Hi! I'm Mariano. I’m both a lawyer and a frontend developer, with a career
      that bridges the legal and tech worlds. For more than 14 years I worked as
      a lawyer in Argentina and Spain, specializing in economic criminal law,
      compliance, and regulatory matters. I served as Court Clerk at the
      Economic Criminal Court of Appeals in Buenos Aires, where I was promoted
      seven times in eight years, and later continued my practice in Madrid.
      Along the way, I led initiatives such as the implementation of a digital
      jurisprudence system that reduced errors in legal decision-making.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-pretty leading-8">
      In 2023, I decided to embrace a new challenge: programming. What began as
      curiosity became a passion, and within a year I landed my first role as a
      frontend developer at a startup. Since then, I’ve been working in both
      fields, applying my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and
      regulatory mindset to deliver reliable and efficient solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-pretty leading-8">
      Today, I see law and technology not as separate paths but as
      complementary. My legal background gives me a strong foundation in
      compliance, risk management, and structured analysis, while my tech skills
      allow me to design and build tools that create value in modern digital
      environments.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-pretty leading-8">
      I’m always eager to learn, build, and collaborate—whether on legal
      projects, tech solutions, or ideally, where both worlds meet. Thanks for
      stopping by!
    </p>
